# Travel Agency - HTML & CSS

This repository contains a personal challenge I undertook to create a static **showcase website** for a travel agency. The website was built entirely by hand using only **HTML** and **CSS**, with no frameworks or libraries.

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to practice and enhance my skills in creating visually appealing, responsive websites from scratch. It is a simple, clean, and fully functional design aimed at showcasing a fictional travel agency.
